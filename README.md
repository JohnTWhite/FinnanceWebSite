# FinnanceWebSite

This site uses Yahoo's api to check the price of stocks by it's symbol. The user has a mock account with an encrpted password stored on an SQL database (I used phpMyAdmin). The CS50 object used was provided by the course I completed, as this was a problem set for that class. The user can "purchase" stock with a fradulent currency of $10,000. They can then "sell" stock with all these transactions being logged into the database that can be quired in history.php by our carefully segregated Model View Controller using php, javascript, and html to comprise our site. 

I included an extra page that allows the user to give them self any amount of the fictious money. Because life is too short to not give away free money. This project solidified the concept of MVC to myself, and is a concept I apply to every project.
